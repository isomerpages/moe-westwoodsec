### WESTWOOD HOMEWORK GUIDELINES


**Definition of Homework**  \
Homework is defined as any learning activity that students are required to do outside the timetabled curriculum and requires follow-up by subject teachers (e.g. marking/grading, descriptive feedback, class discussion, presentation etc.)


**Objectives of Homework**\
Enables students to:

* Apply knowledge and skills learnt in the classroom
* Consolidate their learning
* Receive timely feedback for improvements	
* Realise their responsibility for independent study and strengthen good study habits and skills such as time management and self-evaluation

Allow teachers to: 

*   Check students' understandings and progress
*   Review effectiveness of lesson
*   Provide timely feedback, intervention and support

Provides parents with:

*   Information on the learning progress of their child
*   Opportunity to be more involved in their child’s learning

  

**Key Considerations of Homework in Westwood**\
As a guideline, the total daily homework during school term time **should not exceed 10 hours per week**. For short holidays (March and September), the total homework **will not exceed 2 days**. For long holidays (June and Nov/Dec), the total homework **will not exceed two weeks.**  
The types of homework, which may involve the use of ICT, varies by level and stream, and is guided by the curriculum needs of the subject, as well as the readiness and capabilities of students. The school aims to give purposeful and clearly defined homework which actively involves students and requires thoughtful work. For CCA days, the homework load will be reduced. There will be coordination between teachers to manage the homework load for students in view of peak periods such as during weeks in which Weighted Assessments are conducted. 

  

**Roles of the School**\
The School Management Committee and teachers will work together to review the homework guidelines and to support students with homework strategies and interventions. The school will engage parents on homework matters and provide them with information pertaining to their child’s learning progress.   

**Roles of Students**\
Students are to take ownership of their learning and understand the purpose of homework. Each student needs to keep track of homework instructions and deadlines (by writing them down in the Student e-Handbook). Students need to give their best effort and to manage their time well for homework to be completed and submitted on time. Upon receiving feedback on homework submitted, students should review feedback from teachers and take the appropriate follow-up actions for improvement. 
  

**Roles of Parents**  
Parents are encouraged to create a home environment conducive for studying and completion of homework, to reinforce good study habits and attitudes in support of their child’s learning. Parents can work in partnership with teachers to discuss and be better informed of their child’s learning and development.
