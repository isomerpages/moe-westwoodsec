<h4><strong>WESTWOOD HOMEWORK GUIDELINES</strong></h4>
<p>Homework is a necessary adjunct to classroom teaching and is assigned
regularly to support students’ learning. It aims to enable students to
apply and consolidate knowledge and skills learnt in class, receive timely
feedback for improvement, and develop responsibility for independent study
by strengthening good habits such as time management and self-evaluation.
Homework also allows teachers to check students’ understanding and progress,
review the effectiveness of lessons, and provide timely feedback, intervention,
and support, while keeping parents informed of their child’s learning progress
and offering opportunities for greater involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The amount and type of homework vary by subject, level, and stream, guided
by curriculum needs and students’ readiness. As a general guideline, lower
secondary students can expect approximately 13 hours of homework per week,
while upper secondary students can expect approximately 14 hours of homework
per week. The school is committed to assigning purposeful and clearly defined
homework, coordinating across subjects to manage workload, reducing homework
during peak periods, and limiting daily screen use for homework to under
two hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roles of the School</strong>
</p>
<p>The School Management Committee and teachers will work together to review
the homework guidelines and to support students with homework strategies
and interventions. The school will engage parents on homework matters and
provide them with information pertaining to their child’s learning progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roles of Students</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are to take ownership of their learning and understand the purpose
of homework. Each student is responsible for keeping track of homework
instructions and deadlines using their Google Calendar and Tasks. They
should manage their time effectively to ensure homework is completed and
submitted on time, and always put in their best effort. Upon receiving
feedback from teachers, students should review the comments carefully and
take appropriate follow-up actions to improve their work.</p>
<p><strong>Roles of Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents are encouraged to create a home environment conducive for studying
and completion of homework, to reinforce good study habits and attitudes
in support of their child’s learning. Parents can work in partnership with
teachers to discuss and be better informed of their child’s learning and
development.&nbsp;</p>
