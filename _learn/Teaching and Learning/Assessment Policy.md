<p><strong>PHILOSOPHY&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Quality assessments are essential components in the learning process.&nbsp;
Well-designed assessments provide students, teachers, parents and stakeholders
with information on the learning, development and progress of students.
It also provides feedback on the student’s learning process and informs
how this learning can be improved. Assessment must thus be ongoing and
designed to meet the needs of our students and learning community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Westwood Assessment Policy is aligned to the Singapore Teaching Practice
(STP) model. The principles of assessment are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assessment forms an integral part of Teaching and Learning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment must be aligned to the intended learning outcomes, content
and pedagogy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment facilitates meaningful learning, is learner-centric and has
a formative effect on our students’ learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Assessment System should be balanced – integrating Assessment for
Learning (AfL), Assessment of Learning (AoL)&nbsp;and Information and Communication
Technology (ICT)&nbsp;in the school curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment information should be collected regularly to evaluate current
school practices and enhance future teaching and learning practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AIMS OF WESTWOOD ASSESSMENT POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>It is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Align to MOE’s Assessment Philosophy to achieve a more balanced assessment
system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a common understanding among teachers regarding Assessment Standards
and Expectations</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF ASSESSMENT IN WESTWOOD SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong>
</p>
<p>It seeks to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Facilitate informed decision-making about students’ placement and life
choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report on students’ level of attainment and progress to key stakeholders
- parents, teachers and students</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT IN WESTWOOD</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students need to be lifelong learners to meet the challenges of an
increasingly complex world. To nurture lifelong learners, we need to help
our students experience more joy and develop stronger intrinsic motivation
in learning. In line with MOE’s direction to move away from an over emphasis
on academic results, the school-based assessment structures have been reviewed.
Time and space has been freed up to allow our school to pace out teaching
and learning, adopt effective pedagogies to deepen our students’ learning,
encourage self-directed learning and strengthen holistic development. These
adjustments will provide us with more opportunities for student-centred
teaching and learning approaches and lay the groundwork to nurture lifelong
learning attitudes and skills in our students.</p>
<p>Termly weighted assessments will be conducted to gauge the learning progress
of the students. Timed-practice will only be conducted for Secondary 4
&amp; 5 MTL students in view of their Mid-Year GCE ‘O’ level MTL Examinations.
End-of-Year Examinations will be conducted at the end of Semester Two for
Secondary 1 to 3 students. Preliminary Examinations will be conducted in
the third term for students who are taking the GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examinations.
Performance for termly and end of year assessments will determine students’
promotion to the next level of study, lateral transfers across streams
or retention at the same level of study. For Secondary 2, the results of
the assessment are also used in the allocation of subjects during the subject
options exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of AfL and to allow a diversity of assessment to more effectively
assess students’ learning, other modes of assessment may be included as
part of the termly weighted assessments where relevant.&nbsp;</p>
