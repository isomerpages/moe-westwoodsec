<p><strong>PHILOSOPHY&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Quality assessments are essential components in the learning process.&nbsp;
Well-designed assessments provide students, teachers, parents and stakeholders
with information on the learning, development and progress of students.
It also provides feedback on the student’s learning process and informs
how this learning can be improved. Assessment must thus be ongoing and
designed to meet the needs of our students and learning community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>The Westwood Assessment Policy is aligned to the Singapore Teaching Practice
(STP) model. The principles of assessment are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assessment forms an integral part of Teaching and Learning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment must be aligned to the intended learning outcomes, content
and pedagogy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment facilitates meaningful learning, is learner-centric and has
a formative effect on our students’ learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Assessment System should be balanced – integrating Assessment for
Learning (AfL), Assessment of Learning (AoL)&nbsp;and Information and Communication
Technology (ICT)&nbsp;in the school curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment information should be collected regularly to evaluate current
school practices and enhance future teaching and learning practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>It seeks to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enable students to demonstrate what they know and can do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor progress, and provide coherent and timely feedback for students&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate students' outcomes objectively against the intended outcomes
of the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate informed decision-making about students’ placement and life
choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report on students’ level of attainment and progress to key stakeholders
- parents, teachers and students</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ASSESSMENT IN WESTWOOD SECONDARY SCHOOL&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Termly weighted assessments will be conducted to gauge the learning progress
of students. These assessments will vary in format to assess a broad range
of skills, ensuring a fair and comprehensive evaluation of student abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed-practice will only be conducted for Secondary 4 &amp; 5 MTL students
in view of their Mid-Year GCE ‘O’ level MTL Examinations. End-of-Year Examinations
will be conducted at the end of Semester Two for Secondary 1 to 3 students.
Preliminary Examinations will be conducted in the third term for students
who are taking the GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examinations. Performance for
termly and end of year assessments will determine students’ promotion to
the next level of study, calibration of academic load or retention at the
same level of study. For Secondary 2, the results of the assessment are
also used in the allocation of subjects during the subject options exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
