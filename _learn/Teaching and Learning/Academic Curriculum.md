<p>The academic curriculum serves to guide the school in providing quality
academic programmes for Westwoodians. It is aligned to the Singapore Teaching
Practice (STP) model and Westwood Assessment Policy.&nbsp;Through the academic
curriculum, we seek to nurture every Westwoodian to achieve academic excellence.</p>
<p>There is an emphasis on differentiated instruction and Assessment in T&amp;L
at Westwood. We adopt differentiation in our instructions and programmes
to cater to the different needs of our students. We also believe in providing
opportunities for our students to pursue their interests and hone their
skills and knowledge learnt in class. These opportunities include offering
Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) to our students. These programmes are conducted
in partnership with tertiary institutions such as polytechnics and ITE
and through these programmes students learn to apply what they have learnt
to real life applications. Students are also offered wider subject options
such as Economics during their Upper Secondary years.</p>
<p>Assessment is a systemic, on-going and iterative process of monitoring
oneâ€™s learning. It provides students, teachers, parents and stakeholders
with feedback that not only demonstrates understanding, but also affords
opportunities for reflection that improves the inquiry process. In Westwood,
we believe in continual learning and thus we have aligned our assessment
practices to support continual learning. Students will have the opportunity
to do tasks such as reflections, oral presentations, mini-projects and
ICT-based assessment besides pen &amp; paper tests as part of Assessment
for Learning (AfL). These tasks will provide opportunities for our students
to reinforce their learning and hone their knowledge and skills.</p>
