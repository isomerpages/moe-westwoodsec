<p>The academic curriculum serves to guide the school in providing quality
academic programmes for Westwoodians. It is aligned to the Singapore Teaching
Practice (STP) model and Westwood Assessment Policy.&nbsp;Through the academic
curriculum, we seek to nurture every Westwoodian to achieve academic excellence.</p>
<p>There is an emphasis on differentiated instruction and Assessment in T&amp;L
at Westwood. We adopt differentiation in our instructions and programmes
to cater to the different needs of our students. We also believe in providing
our students with opportunities to pursue their interests and hone the
skills and knowledge learnt in class. These opportunities include offering
Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) to our students. These programmes are conducted
in partnership with tertiary institutions such as polytechnics and ITE
and through these programmes students learn to apply what they have learnt
to real life applications. Students are also offered wider subject options
such as Economics during their Upper Secondary years.</p>
