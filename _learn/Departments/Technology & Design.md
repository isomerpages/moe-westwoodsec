<p>The Live On Festival (LOF) is an initiative by the National Organ Transplant
Unit (NOTU) of Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) aimed at raising awareness
about organ donation and transplant through creative expression. Students
participate by creating artowkr in traditional or digital mediums, sharing
personal interpretations of the theme. This initiative not only promotes
artistic skills but also aligns with the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies
framework in education by fostering social and emotional competencies.
Through this creative process, students cultivate empathy, social awareness
and responsible decision-making, essential for developing a compassionate
and inclusive society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In support of reflective learning in Art, design tasks throughout the
curriculum are based on four domains which <strong>are Document, Curate, Reflect and (Re)present.</strong> These
components support students in building habits of reflective learning and
provide a structured way to express and evaluate their artistic journey.</p>
