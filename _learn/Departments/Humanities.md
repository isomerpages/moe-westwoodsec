<p>Secondary Three Internationalisation Programme – Humanities Learning Journey
to Kanchanaburi &amp; Bangkok, Thailand</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>With the re-opening of borders, post-pandemic, it is an opportune time
to re-imagine Internationalisation Programme in the changing landscape,
the ‘new normal’.&nbsp; The vision of Internationalisation Programme, “Seizing
opportunities, experiencing possibilities,” coincides with the school’s
theme for 2023: “Always Learning, Learning all ways”.
<br>
</p>
<p>With this direction, the department came together to plan for a e21CC
anchored humanities trip to Kanchanaburi &amp; Bangkok, Thailand, starting
from June 2023. Underpinned by the broad concept of authentic learning,
opportunities are engineered for Westwoodians to engage in real-world application
of knowledge and skills. The interdisciplinary nature of authentic learning
also enables students to see connections between humanities subjects and
this would help to ignite their passion and curiosity and foster deeper
“joy of learning” in them. The authentic contexts of learning also facilitates
the use of pedagogies that would deepen 21CC, like inquiry-based learning
(e.g. field-based learning).
<br>
<br>Westwoodians get to experience these:
<br>History:
<br>WWII memorial sites like the Death Railway and Hellfire pass.
<br>
<br>Geography:
<br>Iconic tourism sites like floating market and rooftop urban farm.
<br>
</p>
<p>Business and commerce:
<br>Visit TruDigital Park and engage with entrepreneurs on their experience
and journey.</p>
