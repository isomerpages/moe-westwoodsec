In Westwood Secondary School, we believe in providing our students and staff with a safe and secure environment for holistic development and work. Â To achieve this purpose, we seek strong collaboration with parents and the community.  

  

### SAFETY POLICIES AND GUIDELINES

Safety policies and Guidelines are communicated to all staff and pupils at the beginning of each work year.

  

The School Safety Committee, headed by a Vice-Principal and assisted by various HODs, oversees the development and review of all school safety matters.
