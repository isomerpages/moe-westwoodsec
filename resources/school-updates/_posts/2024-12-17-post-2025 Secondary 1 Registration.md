<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>We are delighted to welcome the newest members of our school community!
The eagerly awaited Secondary 1 (S1) posting results will be revealed on <strong>18 December 2024, at 9 am</strong>.</p>
<p>To access the results, simply go to <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.
Input your child's Birth Certificate number/FIN and S1 PIN. Alternatively,
results can be obtained at your child's primary school or via SMS if you
have provided a local number during the application process.</p>
<p>We encourage you to take your time and enjoy this special moment with
your child. There is no need to head to us directly. Instead, essential
information on reporting details, booklists, and uniform requirements will
be sent via Parents Gateway from <strong>18 December 2024, 3pm</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, for any valid reason, your child cannot start school in January 2025,
please do not hesitate to reach out. Inform the school directly after receiving
the results, and we will gladly confirm and reserve a place for your child.</p>
<p>We look forward to your child into our school community.</p>
