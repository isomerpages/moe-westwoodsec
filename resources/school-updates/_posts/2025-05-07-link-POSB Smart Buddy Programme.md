<p>Our school has been working closely with POSB for the past couple of months
and we are pleased to finally announce that we have successfully implemented
POSB Smart Buddy as an e-payment option in our school canteen and it will
go-live on <strong>16 May 2025</strong>. This is in support of the&nbsp;

all schools in Singapore. With this implementation in Westwood Secondary
School, all our students can now opt to use e-payments for their in-school
canteen purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about the programme can be found in Annex A, B and C.</p>
