**Welcome to Westwood Secondary School!**

Dear Parents, Students &amp; Friends of Westwood,

Thank you for visiting our website and warmest greetings!

I am deeply honoured and privileged to be entrusted the opportunity to lead a school of dedicated and skilful educators who care and develop students holistically in learning and character. I am also grateful for the strong foundations laid by Mr Abdul Harris Sumardi and the leaders before him who have shaped Westwood into the vibrant school that stands tall today.

At Westwood Secondary School, we seek to develop every student to **Lead** Confidently, **Care** Deeply and work as a team to **Win** Together.

_Confidence_ comes from being good at what we do. Every student brings unique strengths which we seek to uncover and develop through our distinctive academic and co-curricular programmes. Students are given opportunities to leverage these strengths and exercise leadership, taking charge of their own learning and being a positive influence within their class or CCA, as well as at the school, national, and global levels through our well-established Internationalisation Programme.

We are also a community that _cares deeply_ and looks out for each other. Care-givers would know that deep care requires courage, commitment and tremendous effort. Our teachers _care deeply_ for every student and we have a culture where students _care deeply_ for each other.

As a team, we strive to win in everything we do, winning not alone, but _winning together_. This is only possible when we support one another, motivate each other and learn to work together, a very important life-skill at the workplace.

I hope you are as excited as I am in welcoming 2026, and I look forward to your support for us as we Lead, Care and Win Together in the coming year!

Mr Brian Tan<br>
Principal<br>
