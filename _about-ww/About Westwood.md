**1. Guidance and Direction**

Just as a lighthouse provides vital guidance to ships navigating through challenging situations, Westwood's vision and mission steer students on their educational journeys. The lighthouse symbolizes our commitment to helping students overcome their challenges and find their path to success and personal growth, rooted in strong character and essential skills. By fostering a sense of hope for the future, we encourage our students to strive for excellence and innovation.

**2. Safety and Security**

Lighthouse serves to be a beacon of safety, ensuring ships avoid dangerous areas and find safe passage. This mirrors our teachersâ€™ commitment to creating a safe and nurturing environment where students can learn and grow without fear.

**3. Strength and Resilience**

Lighthouse is built to withstand harsh weather and turbulent seas, symbolizing strength and resilience. Westwood instills these qualities in our students, preparing them to face life's challenges with resilience and the strength to innovate. Our education system nurtures continual learning and moral courage, empowering students to find solutions even in the face of adversity.

**4. Community and Service**

Serving the broader community of sailors and ships, lighthouses represent dedication to the common good.

By nurturing socially responsible individuals and global citizens, we ensure that our students are prepared to lead and contribute to society.
