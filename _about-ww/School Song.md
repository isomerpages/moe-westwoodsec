**Verse 1**

A happy day is a day we spend in Westwood <br>
A place we call our second home where hearts are big and teachers care <br>
Friends are there to show compassion <br>
Together we make things better

**Verse 2**

A day at Westwood is a day of hopes and dreams <br>
We face our challenges ahead with pride and integrity <br>
We’ll show the world our open minds will help us shine in every way <br>
At the fore we’ll always be

**Chorus**

Like a tree we’re rooted firmly<br>
Spread our branches high and wide <br>
Like a tree we’ll grow so strongly<br>
Lift our crowns to the sky<br>
Like a tree we’re rooted deeply<br>
Standing tall as we learn and grow<br>
Like a tree we’ll grow so strongly<br>
Lifting Westwood to the sky

**Verse 3**

A wholesome day is a day we spend in Westwood<br>
We learn resilience is the key as we reach for what’s ahead <br>
We adapt to changes all around us in our special ways<br>
Pressing onwards to our goals

**Chorus**

Like a tree we’re rooted firmly<br>
Spread our branches high and wide <br>
Like a tree we’ll grow so strongly<br>
Lift our crowns to the sky<br>
Like a tree we’re rooted deeply<br>
Standing tall as we learn and grow<br>
Like a tree we’ll grow so strongly<br>
Lifting Westwood to the sky
