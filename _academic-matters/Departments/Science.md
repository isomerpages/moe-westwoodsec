The experience helps our pupils to discover their strengths and interests and have a taste of how polytechnic courses are conducted. AEMs also employ assessment approaches that are similar to those found in polytechnics, such as project work, group assignments and oral presentations. Each year, we provide opportunities for our pupils to participate in different types of AEMs based on their interests and needs. Some AEMs offered to pupils are Discovering the Science of Flight (Singapore Polytechnic), Digital Integrated Circuit Technology (Ngee Ann Polytechnic) and Discovering Pharmacy (Temasek Polytechnic).</span><br></td>
