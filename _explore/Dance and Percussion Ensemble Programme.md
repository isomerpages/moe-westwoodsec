### HIP HOP/LOCKING DANCE PROGRAMME FOR SEC 1 & PERCUSSION ENSEMBLE PROGRAMME FOR SEC 2

Established Artists has been engaged to conduct weekly Hip Hop & Locking lessons during the 2 periods of Music lessons in Semester 1.  Each Sec 1 student will get to choose to learn Hip Hop or Locking dance. In Semester 2, each Sec 2 student will experience Percussion Ensemble through cajons or their body. The students enjoyed learning how to dance or play to popular songs and at the same time, were imbibed with our school values such as Teamwork & Resilience. 

_“I have benefited much from learning locking. It gotten me to be strong and happy and to bond with my classmates in sec 1 since we were from different primary school.” ~ 1D S.Nithiya Sree d/o Siva Kumar_

_“It was very hard for me to follow the dance movements properly with the class initially, however, it changed. I practiced every day at home and slowly I am able to follow the class. That’s when I started dancing as one of my hobbies. In these dance lessons, I really enjoyed myself and I also have learnt many values like, responsibilities, teamwork and commitment and these values have benefited me much from learning.” ~ 1G Cherie Hazell_

_“I get to play music with my friends and, most importantly, to have fun all together while playing the instruments” ~ 2E Danish Rifqi Bin Mohamed Yusri_
