    <td class="tg-zqva">About</td>
    <td class="tg-cmm0">A school-wide programme in Westwood, ISE involves explicit teaching of skills and knowledge with close connection to real life experiences. It advocates the importance of putting application into practice, highlighting the relevance of what is taught in the classroom in the ‘real world’, giving students a sense of purpose and reality in what they are learning, touching their HEARTs and HEADs and active participation through their HANDs.  The ultimate aim is to develop and inspire Westwoodians to be future-ready learners who possess strong ENTREPRENEURIAL DARE and an INNOVATIVE MINDSET through the application of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).<br><br>
