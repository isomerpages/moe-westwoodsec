</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>A school-wide programme in Westwood, ISE involves explicit teaching of
skills and knowledge with close connection to real life experiences.&nbsp;
It advocates the importance of putting application into practice, highlighting
the relevance of what is taught in the classroom in the ‘real world’, giving
students a sense of purpose and reality in what they are learning, touching
their HEARTs and HEADs and active participation through their HANDs.&nbsp;
The ultimate aim is to develop and inspire Westwoodians to be future-ready
learners who possess strong ENTREPRENEURIAL DARE and an INNOVATIVE MINDSET
through the application of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM).
