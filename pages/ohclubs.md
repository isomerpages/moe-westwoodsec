At Westwood, we offer an exciting array of three distinct clubs: Audio and Visual Aids (AVA), Robotics, and the Westwood Flying Club. These clubs serve as a gateway for our students to delve into a wide spectrum of specialized interests. In AVA, they can dive into the realms of audio-visual equipment, enhancing their creative and technical abilities. Robotics enthusiasts can immerse themselves in coding and the fascinating world of automation. For those who dream of soaring high, the Westwood Flying Club introduces them to the mechanics and art of aviation.
