### Sports

At Westwood, students have the exciting opportunity to select from a diverse range of six physical sports as their Co-Curricular Activity. Our CCA program not only supports their sporting ambitions but also instills crucial values such as sportsmanship, fair play, and the spirit of teamwork.Throughout the four to five years of their involvement in these activities, our students focus on honing fundamental motor skills, preparing them for a lifetime of enjoying sports.
