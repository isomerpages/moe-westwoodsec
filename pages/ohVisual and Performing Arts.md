Our six diverse Visual and Performing Arts CCAs are dedicated to fostering a deep sense of grace and a genuine appreciation for the vibrant culture and rich heritage of our multi-racial society. Through these CCAs, we offer students a unique platform to cultivate a lifelong passion for the art, where we celebrate the beauty of diversity, encourage creative expression, and instill values that will shape students into well-rounded individuals who appreciate the richness of our culture and heritage.
