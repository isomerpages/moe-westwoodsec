# Take A Step

**Verse 1:**

Here we stand, hearts beating as one<br>
This is where I know I’m called to be <br>
Though the road may wander, the journey seems far <br>
If we believe, we will find our way

  

**Pre-Chorus:**

Remembering those lives we have touched <br>
Broken lives made whole <br>
Sometimes all it needs is just for one <br>
To take a step and make a difference

  

**Chorus:**

One heart, one voice <br>
Let’s show the world we care <br>
Just a smile and kind words <br>
Meet a need, heal a hurt <br>
Let us give, let us love <br>
And create a better future <br>
Let us live for a cause <br>
And it all begins, with a step today

  

**Verse 2:**

One life at a time let’s reach out for another <br>
Joining hands to make this a better place <br>
I’m grateful for these friendships I’ve found <br>
Thankful for this place where I call home
