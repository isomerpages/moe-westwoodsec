    <td>**EMBRACE GLOBAL HORIZONS**<br>Westwood's Internationalisation Programme develops 21st-century skills like global awareness and cross-cultural competence in future-ready students. Collaborative learning and intercultural interactions with peers from around the world give them a global perspective and strengthen their connection to Singapore. Our Westwood Ambassadors welcome students and educators from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand to this programme. Westwoodians also travel and have enriching cross-cultural experiences. They learn about the region's diverse cultures and Singapore's global significance by engaging with local communities.</td>

    <td>**FOSTERING FUTURE INNOVATORS AND SOCIAL CHANGEMAKERS**<br>Through our Academic Learning Program (ALP), we instil an innovative mindset by encouraging students to be observant, think creatively, and design solutions. Rooted in design thinking, students develop empathy, identify broad issues, and collaborate to effect change in both the school and the community. Key ALP features include the School Improvement Challenge, where they propose and implement school enhancements. Selected students receive mentorship from entrepreneurs, explore coding and public speaking, and lead community projects, often focusing on sustainability. Through ALP, we nurture innovative and socially responsible Westwoodians.</td>
