<p><strong>EMBRACE GLOBAL HORIZONS</strong>
<br>
<br>Westwood's Internationalisation Programme develops 21st-century skills
like global awareness and cross-cultural competence in future-ready students.
Collaborative learning and intercultural interactions with peers from around
the world give them a global perspective and strengthen their connection
to Singapore.
<br>
<br>Our Westwood Ambassadors welcome students and educators from Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand to this programme. Westwoodians also travel
and have enriching cross-cultural experiences. They learn about the region's
diverse cultures and Singapore's global significance by engaging with local
communities.

<p><strong>FOSTERING FUTURE INNOVATORS AND SOCIAL CHANGEMAKERS</strong>
<br>
<br>Through our Applied Learning Program (ALP), we instil an innovative mindset
by encouraging students to be observant, think creatively, and design solutions.
Rooted in design thinking, students develop empathy, identify broad issues,
and collaborate to effect change in both the school and the community.
<br>
<br>Key ALP features include the School Improvement Challenge, where they
propose and implement school enhancements. Selected students receive mentorship
from entrepreneurs, explore coding and public speaking, and lead community
projects, often focusing on sustainability. Through ALP, we nurture innovative
and socially responsible Westwoodians.
