	<p><b>EMBRACE GLOBAL HORIZONS</b></p>

<p>At Westwood, we're dedicated to shaping future-ready students through our Internationalisation Programme, fostering the vital 21st Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural proficiency. Our students, fondly known as Westwoodians, embark on an incredible journey where they don't just learn but actively "Reach Out to the World." This immersive experience involves collaborative learning and intercultural interactions with peers from around the globe, culminating in a profound international perspective while deepening their connection to Singapore.

In this program, our Westwood Ambassadors warmly welcome students and educators from various overseas institutions, hailing from diverse corners of the world, such as Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. It's a remarkable exchange of ideas, cultures, and experiences right here on our campus.

But that's not all â€“ Westwoodians also spread their wings and explore the world, engaging in enriching cross-cultural experiences overseas. By connecting with local communities, they gain a profound understanding of the diverse cultures in the region, all while discovering fresh perspectives on Singapore's global significance.

Westwood's Internationalisation Programme is your ticket to a broader, interconnected world, right from our vibrant school campus to overseas adventures that will leave an indelible mark on your education. Join us on this incredible journey to "Embrace Global Horizons" and be a part of a thriving, internationally-minded community at Westwood.</p>

At Westwood, we are shaping the innovators and social changemakers of tomorrow.
