1.     Students will not need to report to school on BL days. 

2.     All instructions of learning activities will be disseminated through student’s MOE Student Learning Space (SLS). Students will be briefed and reminded of the expectations on BL days. 

3.     All learning activities are to be completed by the day itself, or if not the due date given by subject teachers. 

4.     Students are encouraged to observe good cyber wellness habits when doing work online. 

**RESOURCES FOR PARENTS**

We hope to partner parents/guardians by inculcating in your child/ward the skills to self-manage and take ownership for their own learning. You may refer to the parent kit for key information on BL and tips on how to support your child/ward on BL days.
