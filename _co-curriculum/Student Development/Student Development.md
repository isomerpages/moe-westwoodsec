### PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH

In Westwood, we believe that all students are unique individuals with different talents and abilities, who can learn and grow, and eventually, make a difference to society. As such, the school has the responsibility to develop each student holistically and to his best ability. This will be done through the provision of equal access to developmental opportunities, and, regardless of level or stream, talents and interests, all students will be ensured of a strong foundation in the knowledge, skills and competencies required for success in life in the 21st Century. Even more importantly, all students will be imbued with strong moral values and a sense of social responsibility, so that they may continue to serve and contribute to their community even after they leave Westwood.

  

In Westwood, student development comprises 3 main components:

*   **Academic Curriculum**
*   **Co-Curriculum**
*   **Student Well-Being**
