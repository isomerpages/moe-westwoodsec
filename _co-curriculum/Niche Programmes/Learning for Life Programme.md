### YOUTH STATION 2021


Nur Aqasha Bin Roslan from Class 2H, was awarded Top 5 with his original song titled ‘Darkest Times’ in the Lower Secondary Category. It is his personal story about how he was able to overcome challenges he had faced in his Primary School. He hopes that this song will encourage the audience to display resilience when faced with obstacles in life. 

Here is his write-up about the song: 

_“Even when times are tough, we should hang in there and not give up, but continue to have hope that everything will be alright eventually. Talking to someone, be it an adult or a close friend, really helps!”  ~Nur Aqasha Bin Roslan_
