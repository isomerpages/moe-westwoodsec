<h4>PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH</h4>
<p><strong><u>Rooted in Character to Soar for the Nation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Westwood, we believe that every child is a unique individual with strengths
waiting to be discovered and nurtured. We see potential not only in academic
achievement, but in the way our students lead, collaborate, and serve.
Every student, regardless of stream, level or starting point, is given
access to equal and meaningful opportunities — to grow in confidence, build
their character, and find their voice.</p>
<p>We are committed to holistic development. Our approach ensures that every
Westwoodian is anchored in sound values, equipped with 21st-century competencies,
and driven by a deep sense of purpose to make a positive impact beyond
the school gates.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Our Three Pillars of Student Development</u></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Academic Curriculum – Building strong foundations for lifelong learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Co-Curriculum – Providing platforms to lead, serve, and shine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Well-Being – Creating a safe, nurturing space where every student
is seen and supported.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Within our Co-Curriculum, students experience:</p>
<p><strong>• Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>• Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>• Student Leadership Development</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>• Values-in-Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>• Lifeskills &amp; Enrichment Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Our Guiding Principles</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Westwood’s student development programmes are anchored in four key design
principles:</p>
<p><strong>Values-based. Developmental. Collaborative. Student-centric.</strong>
</p>
<p>These principles are brought to life through our commitment to nurturing
a <strong>Culture of Care</strong> — one where every individual is seen,
heard, and valued.</p>
<p>At the heart of this culture is <strong>Restorative Practice</strong>,
a whole-school approach that prioritises positive relationships and a strong
sense of community. Our programmes are thoughtfully designed to create
shared experiences between students and teachers — across levels, classes,
and backgrounds. These connections cultivate empathy, strengthen camaraderie,
and sharpen leadership — nurturing both the heart and the mind.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Westwood Promise</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We envision every Westwoodian as a person of character, courage and compassion
— grounded in values, skilled for the future, and ready to make a difference.
This is only possible through the collective effort of our school, parents,
and wider community, working hand-in-hand to grow a generation that is <em>Rooted in character, and ready to soar for the nation.</em>
