<p><strong><u>Because Every Student Deserves to Thrive</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Westwood, we believe that students flourish best in an environment
where they feel safe, supported, and understood. That’s why we place student
well-being at the heart of everything we do — ensuring that care, encouragement
and dignity define every student’s experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A <strong>culture of care</strong> doesn’t just happen — it’s thoughtfully
built through strong staff-student relationships, safe spaces across the
school, and accessible support structures. Every Westwoodian is known,
valued, and given the support they need to grow — socially, emotionally,
and mentally — into a confident individual who takes pride in their identity
and actions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Well-being as a Pillar of Growth</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Student well-being is a core component of the <strong>Westwood Student Development Framework</strong>,
alongside academic learning and co-curricular development. Our approach
focuses on meeting the <strong>social, emotional, mental, and physical needs</strong> of
every child, ensuring they’re not just coping — they’re thriving.</p>
<p>Support is thoughtfully coordinated across the school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The <strong>PE Department</strong> champions physical health and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic departments</strong> focus on cognitive stretch and growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Student Development Team</strong> ensures students’ overall
well-being is continually monitored, supported, and enhanced</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether through proactive care or timely intervention, we’re committed
to helping students build resilience, confidence and purpose.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Support Areas</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Guiding &amp; Empowering Students to Thrive</strong>
</p>
<p>At Westwood, we believe that every student has potential — and some just
need a little more time, space, and support to realise it. That’s where
the Gear-Up Programme comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Gear-Up</strong>, which stands for <em>Guiding &amp; Empowering students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential</em>,
is a structured after-school initiative that provides close mentorship
and a safe, nurturing environment for selected students. Through consistent
routines, guided activities, and caring adult relationships, students develop
stronger school engagement, improved attendance, and higher self-esteem.</p>
<p>Our Gear-Up approach is built on the PIES framework, supporting students
in four key areas:</p>

<p>Together, these domains form the foundation of a safe space where students
are empowered to reconnect, grow, and believe in their potential — one
step, one success at a time.</p>

<p>Students know that help is never out of reach.
<br>All teachers are approachable and ready to support students facing academic
stress, peer relationships, or personal challenges. When deeper support
is needed, students may turn to the <strong>School Counsellors</strong> or
speak with the <strong>Special Educational Needs Officer</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External helplines are also made available to provide students with extended
care beyond the school.</p>

<p>No child should ever be left behind because of financial concerns.</p>

<p>Free textbooks and school uniforms</p>

<p>Our belief is simple: <strong>Every student deserves the opportunity to succeed</strong> —
