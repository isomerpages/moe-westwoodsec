<h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
<p>At Westwood, we aim to develop in every Westwoodian leadership knowledge,
skills, and competencies to:</p>
<p>• Engage in a continual process of self-reflection and self-regulation.</p>
<p>• Lead self and others to make positive contributions to improve the lives
of others.</p>
<p>• Handle complexity and ambiguity in the world with confidence.</p>
<p>We believe that effective leadership is demonstrated through <em>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership:</em>
</p>
<p>1. Model the Way – Lead by example and act with integrity.</p>
<p>2. Inspire a Shared Vision – Create and communicate a compelling future.</p>
<p>3. Challenge the Process – Encourage innovation and embrace change.</p>
<p>4. Enable Others to Act – Build trust and empower teamwork.</p>
<p>5. Encourage the Heart – Recognize efforts and celebrate achievements.</p>
<p>In addition, in times of constant change, <em>Adaptive Leadership</em>—part
of the E21CC competencies—is crucial. Adaptive leadership nurtures students
to embrace change, challenge the status quo and adapt, grow, and lead effectively
in evolving contexts.</p>
<h4>DESIRED STUDENT OUTCOMES</h4>
<p>Through intentional leadership development, our goal is to cultivate adaptive
leaders who:</p>
<p>• Embrace change by anticipating future needs and continually seeking
opportunities to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>• Empower others to commit to developing innovative solutions for future
challenges while ensuring opportunities for students’ voices to be heard.</p>
<p>• Tackle challenges effectively as a team, embracing risks and viewing
mistakes as opportunities for learning and growth.</p>
<p>• Be open to feedback, lead by example, and recognize and celebrate team
contributions, sharing rewards to inspire others.</p>
<h4>PROGRAMMES</h4>
<p>Westwood’s 4-year student leadership development programme is grounded
in three core beliefs:</p>
<p>• Every student has the potential to grow as a leader.</p>
<p>• Leadership is a journey, not a destination.</p>
<p>• Leadership development must be intentional.</p>
<p>We adopt a spiral approach to leadership training, where each year students
experience the three Leadership Domains – Self Leadership, Team Leadership,
and Thought Leadership. They undergo explicit teaching in customized training
programmes such as Cohort Leadership Trainings, followed by opportunities
to apply learning in authentic contexts within and beyond school.</p>
<p>Students are also empowered to take on leadership roles in organizing
events such as the Secondary One Orientation, Teachers’ Day Celebrations,
Prom Night, Student Forum, and other school-wide initiatives and projects.</p>
<p>These experiences enable students to collaborate in teams, sharpen communication
and interpersonal skills, build resilience, and strengthen their ability
to adapt to challenges.</p>
