<h4>STUDENT MANAGEMENT</h4>
<p>Discipline is the cornerstone on which a positive school for teaching
and learning is built. Westwood adopts a whole school approach to discipline
and views student discipline from a holistic and developmental perspective
that goes beyond rules and consequences. Discipline in Westwood is an educative
process where we aim to instill self-discipline and good character in our
students. We also focus on the teaching of Socio Emotional Learning (SEL)
Competencies such as self-management, self- awareness and responsible decision
making. This is to build a community that promotes positive student behaviours
and relationships in support of their learning and growth.</p>
