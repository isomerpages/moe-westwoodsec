#### STUDENT MANAGEMENT

Discipline is the cornerstone on which a positive school for teaching and learning is built.  Westwood adopts a whole school approach to discipline and views student discipline from a holistic and developmental perspective that goes beyond rules and consequences. Discipline in Westwood is an educative process where we aim to instill self-discipline and good character in our students. We also focus on the teaching of Socio Emotional Learning (SEL) Competencies such as self-management, self- awareness and responsible decision making.  This is to build a community that promotes positive student behaviours and relationships in support of their learning and growth.

##### Responsibility of every Westwoodian
* Treat others as you would wish them to treat you â€“ with politeness, respect and compassion
* Take advantage of opportunities offered and learn to the best of your ability
* Contribute to a clean, safe and positive environment that facilitates teaching, learning and personal development
* Maintain good personal hygiene and grooming at all times
* Uphold the name of Westwood

##### SCHOOL RULES AND REGULATION

Rules and regulations help students understand what constitutes acceptable personal and social behaviour. Besides learning, the school is also a community where respectful and caring relationships are formed and nurtured.
